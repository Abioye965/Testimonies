          Awesome teaching support from TAS who did the bootcamp

          Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

          "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of Code.
          I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming
          step by step, I was encourage to enroll by a former student of their's 
          who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
          did not disappoint. They were very hands on and i never had to wait long for assitance. The agile
          team project, in particular was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
          could ever have. In fact, I often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience.
          It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!"
